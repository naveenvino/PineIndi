# Previous Week Indicator

This repository contains a Pine Script v6 indicator that plots the previous week's high and low levels on any timeframe. On timeframes above one hour, it also highlights the extreme bodies of one-hour candles from the prior week.

## Usage
1. Copy the contents of the `PreviousWeek` file into the TradingView Pine Script editor.
2. Add the script to your chart.
3. Toggle **Show Zones** to display shaded areas for the one-hour body extremes on higher timeframes.
